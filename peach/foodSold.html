			<h1>Jim Norton's Coffee Shop's Sales</h1>
			<p>2019 has been a decent year for Jim Norton's.  While snow-peas with pepper sales have been lacking, our tuna casserole sales have been nothing to sneeze at.  And coffee is always popular with the tuna casserole, especially at lunch time.</p>
			<p>When we started keeping track of sales, we only kept track of daily sales.  Then we decided it was important to see sales broken down by pre-lunch, and lunch and afterwords, plus total sales.  These figures are seen in the table below.</p>
